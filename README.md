Programming Assignments
  These are the assignments that my BS in IT program required. Assignments are written in various languages taught in
my degree plan: C, C++, CSS, HTML, SQL, Java, and Android. I primarily use CodeBlocks for C and C++, NetBeans for Java
and Android Studio for Android. I have used MIT's AppInventor for Android apps before but I find that I have more control
over the structure and logic with other IDEs, so I only use it to make quick prototypes. 

Thanks for looking at my school projects and I hope that you can either learn from them or find insight into how I solve
programming problems.
